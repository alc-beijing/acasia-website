CommunityOverCode (formly known as ApacheCon) is the official global conference series of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Since 1998 – before the ASF’s incorporation – ApacheCon has been drawing participants at all levels to explore ”Tomorrow’s Technology Today” across 350+ Apache projects and their diverse communities. CommunityOverCode showcases the latest developments in Apache projects and emerging innovations through hands-on sessions, keynotes, real-world case studies, trainings, hackathons, and more.


CommunityOverCode showcases the latest breakthroughs from ubiquitous Apache projects and upcoming innovations in the Apache Incubator, as well as open source development and leading community-driven projects the Apache way. Attendees learn about core open source technologies independent of business interests, corporate biases, or sales pitches.


The CommunityOverCode program is dynamic, evolving at each event with content directly driven by select Apache project developer and user communities. CommunityOverCode delivers state-of-the-art content that features the latest open source advances in big data, cloud, community development, FinTech, IoT, machine learning, messaging, programming, search, security, servers, streaming, web frameworks, and more in a collaborative, vendor-neutral environment.
